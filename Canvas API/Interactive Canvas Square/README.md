<h1>Interactive Canvas Square</h1>
<p>This is a simple Canvas project using HTML and JavaScript to draw a red square and add interactivity to the canvas. The project was created as a way to practice HTML and JavaScript skills, as well as learn more about the Canvas API and its capabilities.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>To use this project, simply download the source files and open the index.html file in a web browser. The square should be visible on the canvas, and you can click and drag the square to move it around the canvas.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>To run this project, you will need a web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript.</p>

<h3>Built With</h3>
<p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In this example, we're using the getContext() method to get a 2D rendering context for the canvas. We're then setting the fill style to red (#FF0000) and drawing a filled rectangle using the fillRect() method.</li>
  <li>In this example, we've added an event listener to the canvas element that detects mouse clicks and updates the x and y variables with the mouse coordinates.</li>
  <li>We've also added a draw() function that clears the canvas, draws the red square at the new position, and requests the next frame of the animation using requestAnimationFrame().</li>
</ul>
